## 🚀 Quick Start (Ready Now!)

### 1. Install & Setup (2 minutes)
```bash
# Install all dependencies
python3 quick_install.py

# Update environment (add your Supabase credentials)
nano .env
```

### 2. Test Core Functionality (30 seconds)
```bash
# Test security scanning without external dependencies
python3 -c "
from pathlib import Path
from vibeauditor.scanners.real_security_scanner import CustomRulesScanner

# Test with security issues
content = '''
password = \"admin123\"
api_key = \"sk-1234567890\"
'''

scanner = CustomRulesScanner()
issues = scanner._scan_file_content(content, Path('test.py'))
print(f'Found {len(issues)} security issues!')
for issue in issues:
    print(f'- {issue[\"severity\"]}: {issue[\"message\"]}')
"
```

### 3. Start Production Server (10 seconds)
```bash
# Start the API server
python3 run_production.py

# Test in another terminal
curl http://localhost:8000/health
```

### 4. Run Complete Demo (1 minute)
```bash
# See full system in action
python3 demo_complete_system.py
```

## 📊 What You'll See

The system detects these security issues:

🚨 **CRITICAL Issues**:
- Hardcoded passwords: `password = "admin123"`
- API keys in code: `api_key = "sk-1234567890"`
- Secret keys: `secret_key = "my-secret"`

⚠️ **HIGH Priority Issues**:
- SQL injection: `f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = {user_id}"`
- Command injection: `os.system(user_input)`
- XSS vulnerabilities: `innerHTML = userInput`

📋 **MEDIUM/LOW Issues**:
- Insecure random generation
- Hardcoded file paths
- Weak input validation

## 🔧 API Endpoints Available

- `GET /health` - System health check
- `POST /scan` - Upload file and start security scan
- `GET /scan/{scan_id}` - Get scan results
- `GET /scans?user_id={id}` - List user's scans
