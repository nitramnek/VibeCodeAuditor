  - Direct links to official documentation
  - Visual hierarchy with icons and color coding

#### Regulatory Framework Impact
- **Compliance Alert Box**: Severity-based risk indicators (Critical/High/Medium)
- **Framework Violation Grid**: Color-coded display of affected regulatory frameworks
- **Impact Assessment**: Clear explanation of potential audit and compliance consequences

#### Visual Enhancements
- **Severity-Based Color Coding**: Critical issues show red compliance alerts, high issues show orange
- **Interactive Collapsible Sections**: Users can expand/collapse detailed compliance information
- **Professional Badge System**: Clean, professional badges for quick standard identification
- **Comprehensive Metadata Display**: Technical details including confidence scores and CWE mappings

### 2. Enhanced Results Page (`webapp/src/pages/Results.js`)

#### Integration Improvements
- **IssueCard Integration**: Replaced basic inline issue display with enhanced IssueCard component
- **Compliance Overview Section**: Added summary dashboard showing compliance framework violations
- **Removed Unused Imports**: Cleaned up useEffect import that wasn't being used

#### New Features

- **ASVS**: Application Security Verification Standard
- **SANS Top 25**: Most dangerous software errors

### 4. User Experience Improvements

#### Visual Design
- **Color-Coded Risk Levels**: Immediate visual understanding of compliance risk
- **Professional Badge System**: Clean, enterprise-grade visual indicators
- **Intuitive Icons**: Shield icons for security standards, warning icons for compliance risks
- **Responsive Layout**: Works on desktop and mobile devices

#### Information Architecture
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Key information visible immediately, details available on demand
- **Logical Grouping**: Standards and compliance information clearly separated and organized
- **Actionable Information**: Clear remediation guidance with compliance context

### 5. Technical Implementation

#### Data Structure Support
- **Flexible Metadata Handling**: Supports various metadata formats from different rule engines
- **Standards Array Processing**: Handles complex standards objects with names, sections, and URLs
- **Compliance Framework Arrays**: Processes multiple regulatory framework references
- **Backward Compatibility**: Works with existing issue data structures

#### Performance Optimizations
- **Conditional Rendering**: Only renders compliance sections when data is available
- **Efficient Badge Generation**: Smart deduplication of framework references
- **Lazy Loading**: Detailed compliance information only rendered when expanded

## Testing and Validation

### Test Files Created
1. **`sample_issue_data.json`**: Comprehensive sample data matching enhanced system output
2. **`test_compliance_ui.html`**: Standalone HTML test page for UI validation
3. **`COMPLIANCE_UI_ENHANCEMENTS.md`**: This documentation file

### Validation Approach
- **Real Data Structure**: Based on actual Node.js security detection output
- **Multiple Severity Levels**: Tested with critical, high, and medium severity issues
- **Comprehensive Standards**: Includes ISO 27001, OWASP, CWE, GDPR mappings
- **Interactive Features**: Collapsible sections and hover states tested

## Impact and Benefits

### For Security Teams
- **Immediate Compliance Visibility**: Instantly see which regulatory frameworks are affected
- **Audit Preparation**: Clear mapping to specific controls and requirements
- **Risk Prioritization**: Severity-based compliance risk indicators
- **Documentation Links**: Direct access to official standard documentation

### For Developers
- **Clear Remediation Guidance**: Understand not just what's wrong, but why it matters for compliance
- **Educational Value**: Learn about security standards through contextual information
- **Professional Presentation**: Enterprise-grade UI suitable for executive reporting

### for Organizations
